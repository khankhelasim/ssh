# üöÄ SSH Key Setup Automation Script

This script automates the setup of SSH key-based authentication across multiple Linux distributions. It's perfect for:

- Quickly setting up new **lab machines**
- Hardening servers by **disabling password logins**
- Allowing remote login without needing to manually edit SSH configs

---

## üì¶ Features

- Works on **Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, Rocky, AlmaLinux**, and more
- Accepts your public key via:
  - A `.pub` file (e.g., `id_rsa.pub`)
  - Manual input (paste directly)
- Backs up your existing SSH configuration
- Automatically modifies `sshd_config` for best security
- Restarts the correct SSH service (depending on OS)
- Runs system updates in the background

### üõë Warnings
Never share your private key

Make sure key-based login works before locking down password access

You need sudo access to modify SSH and restart services

```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_private_key username@your_public_ip
```
